# Leetcode DSA Tracks
This repo **does not** contains all my previous solves, instead i will me tracking all of my **new and future** LeetCode submissions here in a more organized way

# Purpose
- Revisit problems thoroughly
- Track my growth
- get used to maintaining codebases on GitHub

# Language Used
- **Python2** - ~99% of the time
- **Python3** -  rarely when i need caching related performance benefits[@cache])
- **Cpp** - rarely again but might show up in rare cases
Could shift to Python3 but im so used to Python2
